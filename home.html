						My name is Ahd Abdelhadi. I'm 17 years old and was born in England and lived there for 4 years, but come from Sudan. I've been living here in Saudi for almost 13 years but I've only been in this school for 8 years ever since grade 5. Throughout my life I've been constantly changing my future plans and I'm still unsure of it. However, for now I plan to graduate from university and become successful in my work as a Medical Lab technician. Aside from my future work life, I want to participate in a community service group that go to poor countries to help those in need and somehow want to be involved in many activities that aid others.

						My name is Hajune Lee. Iâ€™m 17 years old and I'm from South Korea. I have been in this school 13 years but I have lived in Saudi since I was born. I plan to go to college then get a stable job for five years. I will then use that money to finance my freelance career as a graphic or web designer.

						My name is Saad-Ur Rehman Syed. I'm 17 years old and I'm from Pakistan.  I've been in this school and in Saudi Arabia for 7 years. After I graduate this year, I plan on studying Aerospace Engineering in university and then working for a large International airline or aviation company. I also want to learn to fly (a plane or glider), visit more than 50+ countries and set a world record before I die. Living on the edge will set me free.

						My name is Yara Sami. I'm 17 years old and I'm from Egypt. I have attended ISG Dammam for 6 years but have lived in Saudi since I was about six years old. I hope to get into college and learn more about art. Hopefully I find a job after that or I could just go freelance. I also hope to adopt a cat and buy the latest graphic tablet.
